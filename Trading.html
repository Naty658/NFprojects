    <h1>Android Trading App Using React Native and Node.js</h1>
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Tools Used:</strong> Developed using VS Code, React Native for the front-end, and Node.js for the back-end.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Language:</strong> JavaScript was used to build the app's core functionality.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Testing:</strong> The app was tested on both the Android Studio emulator and an actual Android device.</p>

    <h2>App Purpose</h2>
    <p>The trading app aims to provide a new way for people to exchange items instead of buying and selling them with money. Many people post items on platforms like Facebook Marketplace or eBay but don't find buyers due to financial constraints or mismatched pricing. However, they may be open to trading items they no longer need and have been sitting unused at home. This creates a mutual exchange where both sellers and buyers can get what they want without spending money.</p>
